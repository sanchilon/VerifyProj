# Page alerts

Use a page alert to notify users of important information or changes on a page.

## When to use this component

Page alerts contain **time-sensitive** pieces of information and typically appear
at the top of a page to capture the user’s attention.

Use page alerts to:

- bring a user’s attention to important page information or system status
- communicate the result of a user action (for example, error or success)

Do not use page alerts to simply add emphasis or highlight content – use
callouts and asides instead.
